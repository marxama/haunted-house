# haunted-house

A project I made for an OpenGL course I had once. Simple but fun. Was before I learned how to program shaders, would be fun to add some to this project. The code is somewhat of a mess - there are lots of things I would've done differently today, but I'm definitely happy with the results and all the (cheap) scares I've achieved!

Made in May 2010.

## Usage

It's been too long since I was into C++. I managed to build it now using Visual Studio. Make sure to have the glut32.dll in the same folder as the .exe for running it (or put it in one of the system folders)

Controls:

<table>
	<tr>
		<td>Mouse</td>
		<td>look around</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>W</td>
		<td>move forwards</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>S</td>
		<td>move backwards</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>A</td>
		<td>strafe left</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>D</td>
		<td>strafe right</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>E</td>
		<td>interact with environment (open doors, pick up keys)</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>F</td>
		<td>toggle flashlight on/off</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>N</td>
		<td>start over (used mostly to check for memory leaks)</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>M</td>
		<td>spin the carousel in the middle</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>0</td>
		<td>toggle whether to fill polygons, or just draw outlines</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Esc</td>
		<td>shut down the program</td>
	</tr>
</table>
