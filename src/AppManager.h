/*
/ This is the core class of the application. It takes care of everything: setting up openGL (including
/ lights and textures), builds and positions the world and objects in the world, handles user input,
/ and manages the application events. Pretty huge. The biggest part of AppManager.cpp is initWorld,
/ which creates all the objects (walls and things like that) of the application.
/
/ The application consists of a number of rooms - three, to be exact, plus two corridors
/ connecting the rooms. These have different ID-numbers to identify them; this is needed
/ for some of the cool scripting stuff, and for some other things. The ID is contained within
/ the bounding box of the floor in each room; the player will "collide" with the floor in each
/ frame, and can thus always keep track of where he is by asking the bounding box for its
/ ID.
/ Please note that this only works IF GRAVITATION IS ACTIVATED
/
/ The ID's are as follows:
/	ROOM 1 (east room)		ID #1
/	ROOM 2 (north room)		ID #2
/	ROOM 3 (west room)		ID #3
/	EAST CORRIDOR			ID #4
/	WEST CORRIDOR			ID #5

/	LIST OF STATE VALUES
/	
/	1	Startup state
/	2	Window in room 3 has been opened. Snowman appears in room 1, looking
/		at the player through the window.
/	3	The player has exited room 3 after state 2. Snowman disappears
/	4	The player as moved from room 2 to the eastern corridor. Demon flashes
/		in front of the players eyes
/	5	The player has entered room 1 again. Perspective and aspect ratio freaks
/		out. Key can be seen on the floor where the snowman was.
/	6	The player has picked up the key. [spin-thingy in the middle of the
/		garden freaks out]. Perspective- and aspect ratio freakout intensifies.
/	7	The player has opened the door to the corridor. SNOWMAN CHARGES!!
/	8	The snowman has reached the player. Black flash, takes a while to
/		recover, but afterwards, no problems. No more freakouts. The player
/		can now open the sliding door in room 3. Uwehehe.
