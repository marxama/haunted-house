/*
/ This class represents a simple grandfather's clock. The modeling is extremely simple, since I felt the point was more about the modeling of the movement
/ of the pendulum and the clock hands, rather than having a nice looking clock (it wouldn't have been difficult to make it, but very tedious). 
/ It actually does keep track of the time, but it assumes that if the FRAMES_PER_SECOND variable is 60, then it will
/ definitely be 60 frames in one second. This is not the case in this project - it actually takes one 60th of a second between updates - so this clock is
/ slower than real life... but on my machine, it's pretty close to the real thing  ;)
